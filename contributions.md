# Summary of Contributions

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member (including yourself) made to your project. 
Both partners should contribute to this file from their own perspectives.
Point form is fine, but you should use the following format:

## Group Work

- We divided the tasks and focussed more on the individual though process as the database was very new to us. Two days later, we collated over videocalls to understand and crosscheck our work

## Contributions

### Afreen's Contributions

- Selecting the database and getting it approved
- Basic study of the database (that will help us in wrangling)
- Wrangling at business level - understanding the meaning of each column and adding appropriate contraints 
- Research question 2
- Video editing and audio scripting

### Akshita's Role

 - Load, explore the datast
 - Intiial thoughts on the dataset
 - Wrangling at technical level - remove duplicates, NAs, conversion of date column
 - Reseach question 1
 - Summary and conclusion

## Things that went well

- The topic was fairly new to us too as we are still learning how the crypocurrency behaves. But it was interesting to understand the database and to relate some of the columns to understand patters
- We were also able to predict some BTC market price (just for fun & learning) however, since it was not in the scope of the project, we did not add it here

## Things that went poorly

- We wish we had an SME, somewhere we felt the wrangling was a lot and still not enough
