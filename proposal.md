## Motivation and Purpose

Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making it accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.

Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are the hot topic these days. Elon Musk's tweets are making them buzzwords of the decade. So we wanted to understand more about it and [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-absolute-beginners-mohit-mamoria/) helped us get started. 

As data scientist, the following questions arose
1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations? 
2. Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? 

We have the price data and we wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. 

In our previous project in Data 550, we started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, we were able to understand quite a few parameters. This dashboard will help understand the other factors related to crypocurrency price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.
