## Motivation and Purpose

Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. Digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making them accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.

### Our role

- 

### Target Audience

- Investors who are interested in investing in cryptocurrency
- People who want to explore the value of cryptocurrency
- People who want to compare the value of each cryptocurrency vs commodities

Things like Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are a hot topic these days. Elon Musk's tweets are making them buzzwords of the decade. So we wanted to understand more about it and [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-absolute-beginners-mohit-mamoria/) helped us get started. 

We plan to answer the following questions
1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations? 
2. Why is there a sudden surge in interest in recent days? 
3. What is the correlation between bitcoin and altcoin prices?
4. What is the average age of the top 10 coins by market cap?
5. What day of the week is best to buy/sell?
6. Which coins in the top two hundred are less than 6 months old?
7. Which currencies are the most volatile?

We have the price data and we wanted to dig a little more into the factors affecting the price of coins. 

In our previous project in Data 550, we started off with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters that affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to Blockchain Info, we were able to understand quite a few parameters. This dashboard will help understand the other factors related to cryptocurrency price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.
